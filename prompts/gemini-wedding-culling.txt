**SCORING GUIDELINES:**
- 0.9-1.0: Album cover worthy - perfect moment with flawless execution
- 0.8-0.89: Gallery highlight - strong emotion with excellent technical quality
- 0.7-0.79: Solid delivery image - good moment worth keeping
- 0.6-0.69: Secondary choice - keep if limited shots of this moment

**WEDDING-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS:**

- Consider the bride's preferences (elegant, fun, traditional, etc.)
- Story completion - some images matter for narrative even if not perfect
- Family members and important guests add value
- Unique moments (first look, vows, etc.) have higher threshold tolerance

**MOMENT PRIORITY:**
- Ceremony moments: Very high priority
- First dance/reception highlights: High priority
- Getting ready/details: Medium priority (but unique details score higher)
- Group photos: Keep best expressions even if composition isn't perfect
